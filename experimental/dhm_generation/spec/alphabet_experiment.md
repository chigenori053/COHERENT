# Alphabet Generation Experiment Specification

See `experimental/dhm_generation/runner.py` and strictly adhere to `COHERENT` project guidelines.

## Objective
Demonstrate that alphabet symbols (A–Z) can be dynamically realized from abstract attributes in a holographic state space.

## Key Constraints
* DO NOT store symbol holograms in MemorySpace.
* ONLY attribute holograms may be stored.
* NO learning, NO gradient descent.
